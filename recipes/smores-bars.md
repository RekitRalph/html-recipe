# S’mores Cookie Bars

## info
* prep time 15 min, cook time 32 min
* 24 bars

## Ingredients

- `1 cup` salted butter (softened to room temperature)
- `1 1/2 cups` packed light brown sugar
- `1 teaspoon` vanilla
- `2 large` eggs
- `2 cups` all-purpose flour
- `2 cups` graham cracker crumbs
- `1 teaspoon` baking powder
- `1/4 teaspoon` salt
- `7-ounce` jar marshmallow creme or fluff (2 containers for little extra)
- `2 cups` milk or semisweet chocolate chips


## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 9X13-inch pan with foil or parchment (for easy removal of the bars after they've baked and cooled). Lightly grease the foil with cooking spray and set aside.
2. In a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed (or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment), beat the **butter** and **brown sugar** until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
3. Beat in the **eggs** and **vanilla** until well combined.
4. Add the flour, **graham cracker crumbs**, **baking powder**, and **salt** and mix until combined.
5. Press half the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan. Dollop the **marshmallow topping** on top of the cookie base and gently spread into an even layer with a lightly greased spatula.
6. Sprinkle the **chocolate chips** on top. Scatter the remaining dough in pieces over the top.
7. Bake until golden brown at the edges but still soft in the middle, 30-32 minutes. Cool completely. Remove the bars from the pan using the foil or parchment overhang. Cut into squares and serve.
